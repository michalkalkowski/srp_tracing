srp_tomo
==============================

Shortest ray path weld map tomography

`srp_tracing` provides a fast ray tracing solver based on the shortest ray path (SRP) principle, belonging to the wider family of Dijkstra methods. The model was created with the intention to be used in ultrasonic tomography and a number of choices have been made to make that task simpler. Consequently, it may not be possible to model every setup straight out of the box.
